x Reuse shaders if we load the same
x Allow multiple scenes to be rendered at the same time
x Implement multiple passes where each scene results in one "pass"
  Depth is cleared between scenes as they are "self-contained"
x Implement a light system that renders the scene in 3D and does
  light calculations + shadowing in 3d space
