* Pain points in using api
x No way to get window dimensions
x Having no callbacks for gui makes it hard to know which component was triggered last
x We have to create a new material for every difference between them. This means that the same shader may be loaded several times which
x is stupid. Should be possible, as with textures, to reuse shaders.
